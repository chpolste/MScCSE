Is it ok that literature review comes before the theoretical foundations (there is another review in the "Related Systems" section)?

Discuss the previous work by \cite[Svorenova2017].

Look at previous uses of GR(1)/LTL objectives and practical applications.
Look at similar hybrid systems covered by other authors.
Present different problem setups and common solution approaches (model checking, automata, games, learning, ...).
