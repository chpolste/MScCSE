Part of this work has been the creation of a web-based application that allows interactive exploration of the considered LSS abstraction-analysis-refinement procedure.
Its purpose is both educational and experimental.
The application supports customizable problem setups in 1 and 2 dimensions and gives the user control over the state space refinement and analysis as well as insights into the product game and system dynamics.
This chapter motivates its development and presents the main features.
