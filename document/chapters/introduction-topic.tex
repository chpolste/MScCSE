What are cyber-physical systems.
Also called hybrid systems.
Name some applications, give simple example.

Encopasses a range of different systems.
Dynamics: deterministic/probabilistic, linear/piecewise affine/non-linear
Control: disrete=switching/continuous
Knowledge: complete/partial.

Verification and synthesis: requires specification
From basic reachability or safety properties to full temporal logics (LTL, CTL, PCTL, and many more).
Specification: qualitative (almost-sure,robust)/quantitative (rewards, bounded probabilities).
Fixed specification/adaptive.

Model checking approach:
Discretization through abstraction.
Common abstractions: MDPs, Markov interval chains, BPMDPs, games, automata.
Continuous space partitioned into convex regions.
Automaton also used for specification.
Synchronized evolution.
Analysis of resulting finite system.

Questions of complexity important, especially as formal methods are picked up by practicioners and applied in robotics, multi-agent coordination tasks and real-time environments such as automated driving.
State space explosion.
Refinement for automatic generation of small abstractions.
