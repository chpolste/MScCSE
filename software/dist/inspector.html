        <h2>Problem Formulation</h2>
        <p>
          The problem considered here, as posed by <a href="#Svorenova2017">Svoreňová et al. (2017)</a>, is:
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
          Compute the set of initial states of a dynamical system such that there exists a control strategy to ensure that the trajectories satisfy a temporal logic specification with probability 1 (almost-sure).
        </p>
        <p>
          More specifically, given a discrete-time linear stochastic system <span class="math">\mathcal{T}</span>, find the set of initial states <span class="math">X_{init} \subseteq X</span> for which a control strategy exists such that the probability of a trace starting in <span class="math">X_{init}</span> satisfies an objective given by a GR(1) formula <span class="math">\varphi</span> over a set of linear predicates <span class="math">\Pi</span> is 1 (almost-sure analysis).
          Furthermore, synthesize witness strategies ensuring the objective with probability 1 for all initial states <span class="math">x \in X_{init}</span>.

    <div class="info-box" id="info-input-objective">
      <p>
        Choose a predefined temporal logic objective and specify propositions for the placeholder variables.
        Labelled linear predicates from the initial state space decomposition can be used as atomic propositions.
        The operators not (<code>!</code>), and (<code>&amp;</code>), or (<code>|</code>) and implies (<code>-&gt;</code>) are available to form propositional formulas.
        They are listed in order of decreasing precedence, parentheses can be used to group expressions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The predefined objectives are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><u>Reachability</u>: After a finite number of steps, the trace has to reach a specified region of the state space.</li>
        <li><u>Reachability/Avoidance</u>: After a finite number of steps, the trace has to reach a specified region of the state space. Until then, another region must not be entered.</li>
        <li><u>Safety</u>: A specified region of the state space must never be entered.</li>
        <li><u>Eventual Safety</u>: After a finite number of steps, the trace must never enter a specified region of the state space again.</li>
        <li><u>Recurrence</u>: A specified region of the state space must be visited infinitely often.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Enabling the co-safe interpretation allows traces to leave the state space once the objective has been satisfied.
        Otherwise an implicit safety property with respect to the state space is required at all times.

        Predicates can be labeled and then used as atomic propositions in the objective specification.
      </p>
      <p>
        E.g.: labeled predicate (label <code>p0</code>): "<code>p0: x &lt; 2y</code>"<br>

        Information about the currently selected state <span class="math">(X_i,\, q_j)</span> of the product game:
        Label of the selected state space partition element (choose by clicking in the state space view) and automaton state (choose by clicking in the automaton view) as well as the successor automaton state based on the satisfied linear predicates.
        The analysis status for all product game states associated with the state space element is indicated by color.

        A dynamics operator is selectable from the dropdown menu which is shown in the state space view.

      <p>
        Player 1 actions of the game graph denoted as <span class="math">X_i \rightarrow \{ X_j \}_{j \in J}</span>.
        The colors show the analysis status of the origin and target states, taking into account changes in the automaton state when transitioning.
        The selection of a player 1 action highlights the associated region <span class="math">\mathrm{ActC}(X_i,\, \{X_j\}_{j \in J}) = U_i^J</span> in the control space view.
        The transition is also depicted with arrows between the origin and target polytopes in the state space view.

        Player 2 actions are shown when a player 1 action is selected in the form of the support sets <span class="math">\{X_k\}_{k \in K}</span> of the probability distribution of the outgoing transition.
        Hovering over a player 2 action with the mouse pointer reveals the corresponding <span class="math">\mathrm{PreP}(X_i,\, U_i^J,\, \{ X_k \}_{k \in K})</span> region in the state space view, where <span class="math">U_i^J</span> is associated with the player 1 action and <span class="math">K \subseteq J</span>.

        Current analysis results can be removed by clicking reset, this allows analysing the system without any product game simplification.

        Also displayed are the current number of yes- (green), no- (grey), unreachable- (red) and maybe-states (black).

      <ul>
        <li>
          Positive refinement enables robust transitions to the yes-region (robust attractor mode) or refines with respect to the <span class="math">\mathrm{PreR}</span> of the yes-region (robust predecessor mode).
        </li>
        <li>
          Negative attractor refinement refines with respect to the <span class="math">\mathrm{Attr}</span> of the no-region.
        </li>
        <li>
          Safety refinement refines robustly with respect to the union of the yes- and maybe-regions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Self-loop removal refines with respect to the <span class="math">\mathrm{PreP}</span> of player 2 actions that lead to a self-loop.
          Optimistic removal only refines if player 2 can force a loop for all player 1 actions, while pessimistic removal always refines if a self-loop is found.
          Unsafe actions can be excluded from the pattern search.

        Transition-based refinement in a robust framework.
        Select origin and target automaton states.
        A reachability/avoidance problem is extracted based on the corresponding transition.
        An additional decomposition into layers is possible.
        Select which layers should be generated as well as the layer-inducing operator.
        The specified number of refinement iterations is performed on the extracted problem(s) with a positive robust one-step kernel based on the <span class="math">\mathrm{AttrR}</span> operator.
        The following options can be toggled:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The target region can be automatically expanded between iterations using the progress guarantee of the refinement kernel.</li>
        <li>Small polytopes where <span class="math">X_i \ominus W = \emptyset</span> can be skipped in the refinement if they are safe (i.e. a robust transition exists for the polytope that fulfills the avoidance condition).</li>
        <li>Postprocessing of the <span class="math">\mathrm{AttrR}</span> region is available to reduce jaggedness: overapproximation with a convex hull or under-approximation by only retaining the largest polytope of the region or by filtering out small polytopes.</li>
