Controller designed by \cite[Svorenova2017]:
Apply actions that make the play corresponding to the trace remain in $\Almost{\ProductGame}$.
Satisfaction is guaranteed by selecting from the available actions in a round-robin fashion.
This is a pure (no randomization) strategy using finite memory (the number of actions is finite).

In general, memoryless strategies exist for all one-pair Streett objectives, because they can be converted into parity-3 objectives for which such strategies are known to exist \cite[authoryears][Chatterjee2012].
They can be derived from deeper analysis of the game.
% TODO: figure out how all the Streett/Rabin/Parity stuff fits together. Does existence of memoryless strategies (which definitely exists for reachability) can be tied into reachability decomposition presented later?
