Game-based vs. geometric condition: game-based requires player 1 actions to be available (if all contain at least one no state in target set, condition is met).
While this is always the case after an analysis, for which the game is constructed, the condition can be expensive to evaluate if multiple refinement steps are taken between analysis.
Action construction is of exponential complexity in number of reachable states.
Alternative: geometric condition, use dynamics to detect situation that requires refinement without requiring the game graph.
