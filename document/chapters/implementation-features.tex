Feature highlights:

Problem setup screen.
Selection of dimensionality, specification of state, random and control space with instant preview.
Definition of linear predicates.
Choice of objective from predefined list, as automatic LTL-to-automaton translation is not integrated yet.
A few predefined problem setups are provided as well.

Inspector.
Visual representation of LSS and state space partition, customizable with zoom and pan as well as image export.
Direct connection to game graph, visualization of player 1 and 2 actions as well as dynamics operators.
Exploration of the product game by combination of the LSS with a selectable state from the objective automaton.
Control of refinement and analysis.
Fine-tuning of refinement configuration and experimentation with different application orders possible.
Aided by snapshot system which can save the current state of the system abstraction and restore it later.
Trace sampling with synthesized controller and inspection of the individual trace steps.
Analysis and refinement reports with information on the product game size and changes to the game.
Connectivity to supporting applications that provide additional plotting and polytope operations.
% TODO: saving/loading snapshots if implemented?
