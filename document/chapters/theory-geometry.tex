In order to describe discrete events in and generate discrete abstractions of a continuous space, a discrete representation of that space is necessary. % TODO phrasing
Convex polygonal descriptions are a popular choice, because convex geometry can be applied to problems of any dimension, has well understood computational properties due to its roots in linear optimization and mature libraries such as MPT \cite[authoryears][Herceg2013] are available. % TODO add CDD, Qhull, ... references
Furthermore, the concept of halfspaces that is central to the representation of convex polytopes works particularly well in the context of hybrid systems with linear predicates. % TODO explain "predicates"?

    A (closed) halfspace $H \subset \reals^n$ is the set of points

    \startformula
        H = \Set{ \Vec{x} \in \reals^n \mid \VecU \cdot \VecX \leq c }
    \stopformula

    that fulfill a linear inequality governed by the normal vector $\VecU \in \reals^n$, $\VecU \neq \Vec{0}$ and an offset $c \in \reals$.
    The normal vector $\VecU$ is pointing away from the halfspace and for convenience and without restriction of generality it will always be assumed that its length is normalized, such that $\TwoNorm{\VecU} = 1$.

    A bounded intersection of halfspaces $\IndexedSet{H_j}{j \in J}$ is a convex polytope $P$ and can be written as

    \startformula
        P = \bigcup_{j \in J} H_j = \Set{\VecX \in \reals^n \mid \MatU \VecX \leq \VecC } \EndComma
    \stopformula

    where $\Mat{U}$ is the stack of transposed normal vectors $\VecU_j$ of the halfspaces, $\Mat{C}$ the corresponding stack of offset values $c_j$ and the inequation holds component-wise.
    This is called the H-representation of a convex polytope.
    % TODO talk about minimal representation by redundancy removal

    A convex polytope $P$ can equivalently be defined as the convex hull

    \startformula
        P = \Hull(X) = \BigSet{ \sum_{i \in I} \lambda_i x_i \Bigmid \forall i : \lambda_i \in \ClosedInterval{0}{1}, \sum_{i \in I} \lambda_i = 1 }
    \stopformula

    of a set of points $X = \IndexedSet{x_i}{i \in I} \subset \reals^n$.
    The vertices of $P$ are the minimal set of points $\Vertices(P) \subset \reals^n$ such that $P = \Hull({\Vertices(P)})$ and uniquely define the so-called V-representation of a convex polytope.

\startsubsection[title={Properties of Convex Polytopes}]

    Convex polytopes have advantageous properties making them a popular choice for practical computational problems in geometry:
    The intersection of two convex polytopes is always a convex polytope and can easily be computed from the H-representations by merging the sets of bounding halfspaces of the polytopes that are intersected.
    Linear transformations of convex polytopes again yield convex polytopes, as seen in section \in[sec:theory-geometry-operations].
    Every non-convex, polytopic region can be decomposed into a set of convex polytopes, e.g. by triangulation. % TODO adapt to higher dimensions. Baotic procedure? Reduction to simplices after triangulation of surface?
    Results based on convex polytopic geometry are therefore applicable to non-convex polytopic geometry after decomposition.
    % TODO easy to test if points inside, centroid is always inside

    In this work, all polytopes discussed are convex polytopes and the word \quotation{polytope} will always refer to a convex polytope.
    Furthermore, only full-dimensional polytopes are considered here, i.e. polytopes into which a non-empty ball of the dimension that the polytope is embedded in can fit.
    All other polytopes are treated as empty, particularly all lower-dimensional polytopes.
    Due to limitations imposed by computational geometry with floating point numbers, no distinction between closed and open polytopes/halfspaces is made and the closed form is favoured in the text.

\startsubsection[title={Operations on Convex Polytopes},reference=sec:theory-geometry-operations]

    The following linear transformations of a convex polytope $X \in \reals^n$ are defined:
    application of a matrix $\MatA \in \reals^{m \times n}$ from the left and translation by a vector $\VecV \in \reals^m$

    \startformula
        \MatA X + \VecV \colonequals \Set{ \VecY \in \reals^m \mid \exists \VecX \in X : \VecY = \MatA\VecX + \VecV }
    \stopformula

    and application of a matrix $B \in \reals^{n \times n}$ from the right

    \startformula
        X \MatB \colonequals \Set{ \VecY \in \reals^m \mid \MatU \MatB \VecY \leq \VecC } \EndPeriod
    \stopformula

    The identity $X\MatB = \MatB^{-1}X$ holds for all invertible matrices $\MatB$. % TODO: proof (at least a sketch)? relevant at all?
    Note that the application of a matrix from either side may change the dimension of the polytope.

    Aside from the usual set operations like intersection, union and difference which can be applied to convex polytopes (which are convex sets of points in the embedding vector space), two additional binary operations are defined for polytopes $X, Y \in \reals^n$. The Minkowski sum

    \startformula
        X \oplus Y \colonequals \Set{ \VecZ \in \reals^n \mid \exists \VecX \in X, \exists \VecY \in Y : \VecZ = \VecX + \VecY}
    \stopformula

    can be computed by translating every vertex of $X$ with every vertex of $Y$ and then taking the convex hull of the resulting set of points.
    The Pontryagin difference

    \startformula
        X \ominus Y \colonequals \Set{ \VecZ \in \reals^n \mid \forall \VecY \in Y : \VecZ + \VecY \in X }
    \stopformula

    can be computed by translating every halfspace of X by every vertex of Y and then taking the intersection of these halfspaces.
    While the Minkowski sum is commutative, the Pontryagin difference is not.
    Minkowski sum and Pontryagin difference are not inverse operations.
    In general it only holds that

    \startformula
        (X \ominus Y) \oplus Y \subseteq X
    \stopformula

    \cite[authoryears][Baotic2009].
    This is illustrated in Figure \in[fig:theory-geometry-operations], where a concrete counterexample is provided showing that Minkowski sum cannot generally invert a Pontryagin difference operation.
    It should furthermore be noted that

    \startformula
        X \ominus Y \neq X \oplus (-Y)
    \stopformula

    in general.
