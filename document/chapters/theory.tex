This chapter introduces basic concepts and notation needed to adequately express the core topics of this work.
The introduction to these concepts is neither exhaustive nor entirely rigorous and favours short formulations of the fundamental ideas required for subsequent chapters of this work over extensive and detailed definitions.
A rigorous treatment of this content has been presented many times before by other authors.
References to some of these are provided in the text and should be consulted by the interested reader.
Specifically, \cite[Baier2008] are cited often as they are a good resource for the basics of model checking.
