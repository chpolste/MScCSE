Where to go next?  What doesn't work yet?
More complicated, multi-stage objectives.
Potent game-solver for objectives not expressible with parity 3 (nothing stands in the way of full LTL).
Better, automated selection of transitions for refinement targets and controller synthesis.
Higher dimensions in practice.
Refinement that takes probabilistic aspects of system fully into account.

Where are limitations and what seems possible?
Expectation is that higher dimensions quickly eat up improvements in refinement efficiency (see corridor vs double integrator game size with only one dimension difference in control space).
Is approach compatible with quantitative analysis?
