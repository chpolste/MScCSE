\cite[Svorenova2017] used the notion of negative refinement, looking at player 1 states where player two can ensure to win the game with non-zero proability.
They refine a state $\Tuple{\State{i}}{q}$ if

\placeformula[fml:refinement-negative-unsafecondition]
\startformula
    \forall (\PlayerOneAction{i}{J}) \in Act \quad \exists (\PlayerTwoAction{i}{J}{K}) \in Act \quad \exists k \in K : \State{k} \in \NoStates{q'} \EndPeriod
\stopformula

Repeat $\Attr$-based refinement and extend it with a second procedure that covers additional cases detected by this condition.


\startbuffer[buf:refinement-negative-attractor-algorithm]
    \startalgorithmic[numbering=no,margin=0em]
        \INPUT{Player 1 state $\Tuple{\State{i}}{q}$}
        \OUTPUT{Partition $Y = \IndexedSet{Y_n}{n \in N}$: $\displaystyle \bigcup_{n \in N} Y_n = \State{i}$}
    \stopalgorithmic
    \startalgorithmic
        \STATE{$Y \leftarrow \Set{\State{i}}$}
        \FORALL{$q \in Q$}
            \IF{$\State{i} \in \MaybeStates{q}$}
                \STATE{$q' \leftarrow \QNext{i}{q}$}
                \STATE{$Y' \leftarrow \emptyset$}
                \FORALL{$Y_n \in Y$}
                    \STATE{$A \leftarrow \Attractor{Y_n}{\ControlSpace}{\NoStates{q'}}$}
                    \STATE{$Y' \leftarrow Y' \cup \Convexify(A) \cup \Convexify(Y_n \setminus A)$}
                \ENDFOR
                \STATE{$Y \leftarrow Y'$}
            \ENDIF
        \ENDFOR
        \RETURN{Y}

Refining with $\Attractor{\State{i}}{\ControlSpace}{\NoStates{q'}}$ yields region of guaranteed bad-states.
No-stuff is inevitable, every control input has non-zero probability of leading to bad state for every state in polytope.

TODO algorithm

Impossible to do better and still have a guarantee for reachability problem.
Good idea to always do this first as it has a guarantee.

This is much stricter than condition (\in[fml:refinement-negative-unsafecondition]), where bad stuff can be avoided if player 2 plays cooperatively.
For the Attractor states removed here, game cannot be won even if player 2 plays cooperatively.
