Part of this work has been the creation of a web-based application that allows interactive exploration of the presented LSS abstraction-analysis-refinement procedure.
Its purpose is both educational and experimental.
The application supports customizable problem setups in 1 and 2 dimensions and gives the user control over system refinement and analysis as well as controller synthesis.
This chapter motivates its development and presents the main features.
