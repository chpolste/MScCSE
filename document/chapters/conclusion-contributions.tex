    \item{A multi-step refinement framework based on robust dynamics has been developed and successfully tested.}
    \item{A decomposition technique induced by the transitions of the objective automaton is described that allows to apply refinement techniques for reachability problems to systems with any specification.}
    \item{The class of neutral refinement techniques is introduced. These techniques aim to transfer power in the game graph from player 1 to player 2. They are useful as supportive refinement for other procedures.}
    \item{An accessible implementation of the abstraction-analysis-refinement solution scheme in form of an interactive visualization tool is presented.}
