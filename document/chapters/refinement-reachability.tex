Refinement necessary component due to introduction of abstraction.
Combines analysis results and knowledge of dynamics into useful heuristics.
Presented here are a few heuristics.

Why reachability is the only problem that needs to be solved: in product automaton, for each copy of the LSS abstraction states a reachability problem can be solved with the target of reaching a region that enables an automaton transition.
By targeting individual transitions, the refinement decomposes into a series of reachability problems.
Therefore, presentation of positive refinement here for reachability only.

Problem of selection of transitions for refinement is complex, automaton is hard, pops up again in controller synthesis.
Refine every transition, but some may be unused in a winning strategy.
Generally, an existing yes region is not available.
Exception is co-safe objectives: work backwards from final states, which are immediately satisfying.
For infinite objectives, which many transitions optimal path through the automaton is not obvious.
