The presented refinement procedures are applied in 2 case studies for comparison and performance assessment.
Particular attention is given to the robust positive refinement for reachability problems.
Multiple configurations are compared in the first case study, a basic reachability problem with 2-dimensional double integrator dynamics.
This exact problem was previously examined in detail by \cite[Svorenova2017].
A second case study is concerned with a more complex objective with 3 automaton states and a 2-dimensional control space.

All case studies were run on a machine with an Intel i5-4500U Haswell CPU (1.6 GHz base clock, 2.6 GHz turbo) and 8 GB of main memory.
The JavaScript routines from the interactive system explorer were run inside node.js without parallelism.
