The verification and synthesis problem is considered for linear stochastic systems and specifications from the GR(1) fragment of LTL.

Previously posed and solved by \cite[Svorenova2017] with an analysis and iterative refinement procedure for a 2Â½-player game abstraction.
Here, propose a robust refinement framework.

General GR(1).
Automaton- and system dynamics-driven decomposition scheme.
Major challenge is state space explosion caused by overrefinement of the state space.
Post-processing to combat this.

The framework is applied in two case studies.
A reachability problem with double integrator dynamics.
Results show improved performance compared to the refinement of \cite[Svorenova2017].
