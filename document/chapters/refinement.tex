The game-based abstraction requires a state space partition from which to derive player 1 states.
As set up in section \in[sec:abstraction-graph-playerone], the initial partition is governed by the set of linear predicates.
This partition makes sense because it allows a unique association of states to sets of (satisfied) linear predicates, but in general the partition will be too coarse to answer a given analysis question, leaving most states in the set $P_\Maybe$.

In this chapter, procedures are presented that refine the partition so that a solution to the analysis problem can be found.
Ideally, the procedures should work without manual intervection, so that the abstraction-analysis-refinement cycle from Figure \in[fig:problem-approach-flowchart] is able to solve a given analysis problem autonomously.
