This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts and notation needed to express the content of this work.
The introductions are kept relatively brief.
The interested reader is invited to consult the references in the text for a more extensive treatment of the presented topics.
In particular, the book of \cite[Baier2008] is an excellent resource for everything related to model checking and \cite[Baotic2009] provides a good introduction to polytopic geometry for control problems.
