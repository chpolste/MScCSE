Find the set of initial states for which there exists a control strategy such that a trace starting in the initial state and using the control strategy satisfies a given objective with probability 1.
This is called almost-sure analysis.
For objectives that can be satisfied in finite time: consider both infinite and co-safe objective.
Difference: in the infinite interpretation trace is never allowed to leave the state space, while in co-safe interpretation trace can go anywhere once the objective has been satisfied.

Simplified, but important variant: only consider reachability objectives.
