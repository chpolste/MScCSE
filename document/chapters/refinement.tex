The game-based abstraction requires a partitioning of the state space.
The chosen initial partition based on the linear predicates of the objective will generally be too coarse and requires refinement.
Heuristic procedures presented too, yielding a fully automatic algorithm.

Introduce next q operator. % TODO
Overload yes, maybe, no sets: polytopic region in geometric context but also set of states in game context.
