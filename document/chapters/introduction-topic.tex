What are cyber-physical systems.
Also called hybrid systems.
Encopasses a range of different systems.
Dynamics: deterministic/probabilistic, linear/piecewise affine/non-linear
Knowledge: complete/partial.
Control: disrete=switching/continuous
Specification: qualitative (almost-sure,robust)/quantitative (rewards, bounded probabilities).
Fixed specification/adaptive.
From basic reachability or safety properties to full temporal logics (LTL, CTL, PCTL, and many more).

The number of approaches within the model checking framework is as diverse as the properties of the hybrid systems as every combination requires or suits different techniques.
Questions of complexity important, especially as formal methods are picked up by practicioners and applied in robotics, multi-agent coordination tasks and real-time environments such as automated driving.

One particular approach was first introduced by \cite[Svorenova2017] for discrete-time, linear stochastic systems with continuous state and control spaces, verified with respect to almost-sure satisfaction of specifications from the General Reactivity (1) fragment of linear temporal logic.
The approach uses a 2Â½-player game abstraction build on iteratively refined partitions of the state and control space to construct a sound verification procedure.
It is the foundation this work builds on.
