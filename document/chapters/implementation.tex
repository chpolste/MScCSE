Major aspect of this work was the creation of a web-based application that allows exploration of a linear stochastic system and its abstraction interactively.
Its purpose is educational on the one hand and experimental on the other.
In addition to easy problem setup for 1- and 2-dimensional systems, the interface contains controls for system refinement, analysis and controller synthesis.
