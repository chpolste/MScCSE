Automata provide a way to represent a language.
A Language contains words made up from symbols originating from an alphabet.
An automaton is a transition system constructed such that any given word induces a run, which is either accepted or rejected.
All words inducing accepted runs are part of the language of the automaton, while rejected words are not.
Many different types of automata exist for many different types of languages.
In this work, deterministic finite-state automata (DFAs) and languages containing infinite words are of interest, for which \omega-automata are appropriate.

Before defining \omega-automata, some notation for working with languages is introduced:
The language of an automaton ${\mathcal A}$ is denoted as $\Language({\mathcal A})$.
A word is written as a sequence of symbols, e.g. $w_0 w_1 w_2$.
The set of all finite words over an alphabet $\Sigma$ is written as $\RepeatFinitely{\Sigma}$, while the set of all infinite words is written as $\RepeatInfinitely{\Sigma}$.
This notation is more generally used for sets of sequences and for (\omega-)regular expressions over an alphabet, where it represents finite ($\RepeatFinitely{\,}$) or infinite ($\RepeatInfinitely{\,}$) recurrence of a symbol (consult chapter 4 in the book of \cite[Baier2008] for a more thorough introduction to regular expressions).

    A deterministic \omega-automaton is type of DFA, specified by a tuple 

    \startformula
        \mathcal{A} = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, \mathcal{C}) \EndComma
    \stopformula

    where
    $Q \neq \emptyset$ is a finite set of states,
    $\Sigma$ is a finite alphabet of symbols,
    $\delta: Q \times \Sigma \rightarrow Q$ is a deterministic transition function,
    $q_0 \in Q$ is the initial state of the automaton.
    If the transition function is defined for every combination of state from $Q$ and symbol from $\Sigma$, the automaton is called complete otherwise is is called incomplete.

    A run is an infinite sequence of states $q_0 q_1 ... \in \RepeatInfinitely{Q}$ such that $q_{i+1} = \delta(q_i, w_i)$, $w_i \in \Sigma$ for all $i \in \naturalnumbers_0$.
    Every run is associated with a word $w = w_0 w_1 ... \in \RepeatInfinitely{\Sigma}$, induced by the symbols that label the transitions.
    The purpose of the acceptance condition $\mathcal{C}$ is to specify which words are accepted by the automaton and therefore part of $\Language({\mathcal A})$ and which which words are rejected.
    It can be expressed in different ways.

\startsubsection[title={Acceptance Conditions}]

    For a run to be accepted by the automaton it has to start in the initial state $q_0$ and all transitions required to realize the run have to be defined by the transition function.
    In case of an incomplete automaton, all words that require a transition not defined by $\delta$ in their corresponding run are rejected.
    In addition to these basic requirements of accepted runs, the acceptance condition specifies further restrictions.

    Formally, the acceptance condition ${\mathcal C}$ divides the set of all runs into a set containing all accepted runs and a set containing all not accepted runs.
    A word is called accepted if the corresponding run is accepted.
    The set of all accepted words is the language of the automaton.
    Since there are usually infinitely many accepted words, the acceptance condition is expressed by other means than a set of words.

    A Büchi condition is expressed by a set of states and requires that at least one state from this set is visited infinitely often in every accepted run.
    A generalization of the Büchi acceptance condition is the Büchi-implication condition, also known as the one-pair Streett condition.
    It is specified by a tuple of sets $\mathcal{C} = (E, F) \subseteq Q \times Q$ and accepts all runs $r$ satisfying

    \startformula
        (\InfinitelyOften{r} \cap E \ne \emptyset) \Longrightarrow (\InfinitelyOften{r} \cap F \ne \emptyset) \EndComma
    \stopformula

    where the set of states which occur infinitely often in the run $r$ is denoted by $\InfinitelyOften{r}$.
    I.e., in every accepted run an infinite occurrence of at least one state from $E$ implies that at least one state from $F$ is also visited infinitely often.

    \placefigure[top][fig:theory-automaton-example]{

    For example, consider the automaton with one-pair Streett acceptance condition

    \startformula
        (\Set{q_0, q_1, q_2}, \Set{a, b, c, d}, \delta, q_0, (\Set{q_0}, \Set{q_2})) \EndComma
    \stopformula

    where the transition function defines $\delta(q_0, a) = q_0$, $\delta(q_0, b) = q_1$, $\delta(q_1, c) = q_2$ and $\delta(q_2, d) = q_2$.
    This automaton accepts all words starting with a finite number of $a$s, followed by a single $b$, a single $c$ and then $d$s forever, i.e. all words of the form $\RepeatFinitely{a} b c \RepeatInfinitely{d}$.
    It is shown in Figure \in[fig:theory-automaton-example], which demonstrate show states from one-pair Streett acceptance sets $E$ (dashed border) and $F$ (double border) are highlighted in automaton depictions here.
