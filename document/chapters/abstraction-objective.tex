Initially the partition is given by the linear predicates $\Predicates$, therefore all states $\VecState$ in every state $\State{i}$ fulfil exactly the same set of linear predicates and don't fulfil exactly the same set of linear predicates.
Predicates that are true in a given state $\State{i}$

\startformula
    \PredicatesOf{\State{i}} = \Set{ p \in \Predicates \mid ... }
\stopformula

(Synchronous) Product game from LSS abstraction and automaton representing GR(1) LTL formula as defined in section \in[sec:theory-automata-omega]:

\startformula
    \Automaton = (Q,\, 2^\Predicates,\, \Transition_\Automaton,\, q_0,\, \Condition_\Automaton) \EndPeriod
\stopformula

One-pair street condition $\Transition_\Automaton = \Tuple{E_\Automaton}{F_\Automaton}$.
