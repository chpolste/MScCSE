Build game graph as introduced in section \in[sec:theory-games-games].

\startformula
    \GameGraph = (G_1, G_2, Act, \delta_\GameGraph)
\stopformula

Player 1 states are called like the indices of their corresponding polytopes $\State{i}$ from the state space partition.
A set of outer states, from $\ExtendedStateSpace \setminus \StateSpace$ (states from $\StateSpace$ being called inner states) is added to the game graph to simplify handling of transitions out of the state space.

\startformula
    G_1 = \IndexedStates{i}{J}
\stopformula

where $\State{i} \subseteq \ExtendedStateSpace$ and disjunct $\State{i} \cap \State{j} = \emptyset$ for all $i \neq j$.  
It should be clear from context if state of associated polytope is meant.
If not, it will be clarified explicitly.
Player 2 states.

\startformula
    G_2 = \BigSet{\Tuple{\State{i}}{J} \Bigmid i \in I \MidAnd J \subseteq I}
\stopformula

Player 1 actions represent the control that is excerted externally on the evolution on a trace, they correspond to disjunct regions of the control space that can be selected as control input.
Transitions are deterministic, i.e. there is only one possible successor for every player 1 action picked.
Player 2 actions represent ...

\startformula
    Act = \BigSet{\PlayerOneAction{i}{J} \Bigmid i \in I \MidComma J \subseteq I} \,\cup\,
          \BigSet{\PlayerTwoAction{i}{J}{K} \Bigmid i \in I \MidComma K \subseteq J \subseteq I}
\stopformula

Now the transition relation $\delta_\GameGraph$ can be defined.
For player 1 states and actions:

\startformula
    \delta_\GameGraph
        \Big( \State{i}, \PlayerOneAction{i'}{J'} \Big)
        \Big( \Tuple{\State{i}}{J} \Big)
    = \startmathcases
        \NC 1
        \MC \startgathered
                \NC i = i' \MidAnd J = J'
                \NR
                \NC \quad \MidAnd \ConcreteAction{\State{i}}{\IndexedStates{j}{J}} \neq \emptyset
                \NR
            \stopgathered
        \NR
        \NC 0
        \NC otherwise \EndPeriod
        \NR
    \stopmathcases
\stopformula

For player 2 states and actions:

\startformula
    \delta_\GameGraph
        \Big( \Tuple{\State{i}}{J}, \PlayerTwoAction{i'}{J'}{K} \Big)
        \Big( \State{k} \Big)
    = \startmathcases
        \NC \displaystyle\frac{1}{|K|}
        \MC \startgathered
                \NC i = i' \MidAnd J = J' \MidAnd k \in K
                \NR
                \NC \quad \MidAnd \PrecisePredecessor{\State{i}}{U_i^J}{\IndexedStates{k}{K}} \neq \emptyset
                \NR
            \stopgathered
        \NR
        \NC 0
        \NC otherwise \EndComma
        \NR
    \stopmathcases
\stopformula

Relation between player 2 actions and supports.

where $U_i^J = \ConcreteAction{\State{i}}{\IndexedStates{j}{J}}$ is the control input associated with the player 1 action $\PlayerOneAction{i}{J}$ that lead to the player 2 state from player 1 state $\State{i}$.
Simplified probability distribution: don't care about the actual transition probabilities since only almost sure analysis is considered here, where all non-zero probabilities are equivalent.
Outer states have no actions but can be used as transition targets for inner states.

While finding the solution to a given problem on the LSS, the partition will be subject to change when refinement takes place.
