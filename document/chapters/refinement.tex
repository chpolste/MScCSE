Two questions asked of problem:
1. is it possible to almost surely satisfy the objective from a given initial state? (analysis)
2. if yes, how? (synthesis)

The first question can be answered by solving the product game.
The objective can be satisfied in all winning player 1 initial states almost surely.
The second question requires the synthesis of a controller.
While synthesis of "a" controller is easy, finding an optimal controller (and figuring out what an "optimal" controller even is) is more involved and only considered briefly here.

The game-based abstraction requires a partitioning of the state space.
The chosen initial partition based on the linear predicates of the objective will generally be too coarse and requires refinement.
Heuristic procedures presented too, yielding a fully automatic algorithm.

Finally, properties of this complete algorithm such as complexity, convergence, correctness are discussed.
