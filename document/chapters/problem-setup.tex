corresponds to discrete-time, continuous-space MDP.

State space, control space and random space are convex polytopes (simplification, non-convex shapes can always be generated through the introduction of safety/avoidance objectives).
Traces are defined in the state space and fulfil the evolution equation at every step, control strategies as TODO.

Objective from GR(1) LTL or generally every objective expressible by a one-pair Streett automaton, linked to LSS by a set of linear predicates.
