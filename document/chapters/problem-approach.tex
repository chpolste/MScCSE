The analysis and synthesis problems for the given LSS setup have been previously solved by \cite[Svorenova2017] with an iteratively refined, game-based abstraction.
Their solution procedure is depicted in \in{Figure}[fig:problem-approach-flowchart] and summarized in this section.
The individual steps are then reviewed in detail in the following chapter.

First, a 2Â½-player game abstraction of the LSS is constructed based on a state-space partition and its dynamics.
In the game, one player controls the evolution of a trace while the other player represents the uncertainty introduced by the abstraction model.
For computational convenience, convex polytopic partitions are chosen.
The initial state-space partition is induced by the set of linear predicates.

Next, the objective is translated to a deterministic \omega-automaton and the synchronous product of this automaton and the game graph is constructed.
The resulting game's winning condition is modelled on the one-pair Streett acceptance condition of the automaton.
The product game is then solved once for an adversarial player 2 and once for a cooperative player 2.
With both solutions, regions of the state space can be identified as parts of $\InitialStates$ or $\StateSpace \setminus \InitialStates$.
However, some regions can remain undecided because of a too coarse abstraction.
Therefore, refinement is applied to the state-space partition.
Based on the game solutions and system dynamics, a new state space partition is constructed and the procedure returns to the abstraction phase and iterates.

The procedure is constructed such that after every iteration, a partial solution to the problem is obtained \cite[authoryears][Svorenova2017].
This means that once a region of the state space has been identified as a part of $\InitialStates$ or $\StateSpace \setminus \InitialStates$, this identification is provably correct and will not change in subsequent analyses or due to refinement activity.
If the procedure terminates, the analysis problem from \in[sec:problem-statement-analysis] is solved.
However, refinement heuristics can only provide progress guarantees in some circumstances and there are systems for which this procedure will provably never terminate.

Finally, a controller is synthesized based on the game graph and the analysis results.
