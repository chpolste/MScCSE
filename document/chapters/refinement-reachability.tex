Why reachability is the only problem that needs to be solved:
in product automaton, for each copy of the LSS abstraction states a reachability problem can be solved with the target of reaching a region that enables an automaton transition.
By targeting individual transitions, the refinement decomposes into a series of reachability problems.
Therefore, presentation of positive refinement here for reachability only.

Still playing on same LSS $\LSS$, start with the same partition as current abstraction but only a simple co-safe reachability/avoidance winning condition:

Reach: states where a transition to the transition target automaton state happens with the next player 1 action.

\startformula
    \ReachStates{q}{q'} = \Set{ \State{i} \mid \Tuple{\State{i}}{q} \in P_1 \MidAnd \State{i} \notin \NoStates{q} \MidAnd \QNext{i}{q} = q' }
\stopformula

Refine: states which are refined, from which it is hopefully possible that objective can be fulfilled.
What about yes-states?

\startformula
    \RefineStates{q}{q'} = \Set{ \State{i} \mid \Tuple{\State{i}}{q} \in P_1 \MidAnd \State{i} \notin \NoStates{q} \MidAnd \QNext{i}{q} = q }
\stopformula

Avoid: states where a transition to any other automaton state happens with the next player 1 action, no-states and unreachable states.

\startformula
    \AvoidStates{q}{q'} = \IndexedStates{i}{I} \setminus \left( \ReachStates{q}{q'} \cup \RefineStates{q}{q'} \right)
\stopformula

If $q = q'$, refine states and safe states are the same, special case of safety objective.

Problem of selection of transitions for refinement is complex, automaton is hard, pops up again in controller synthesis.
Refine every transition, but some may be unused in a winning strategy.
Generally, an existing yes region is not available.
Exception is co-safe objectives: work backwards from final states, which are immediately satisfying.
For infinite objectives, which many transitions optimal path through the automaton is not obvious.
