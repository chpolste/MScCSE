Refinement necessary component due to introduction of abstraction.
Combines analysis results and knowledge of dynamics into useful heuristics.
Presented here are a few heuristics.

Why reachability is the only problem that needs to be solved: in product automaton, for each copy of the LSS abstraction states a reachability problem can be solved with the target of reaching a region that enables an automaton transition.
By targeting individual transitions, the refinement decomposes into a series of reachability problems.
Therefore, presentation of refinement here for reachability only.
Problem of selection of transitions for refinement is complex, automaton is hard, pops up again in controller synthesis.
