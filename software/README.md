## Development Environment

I'm writing JavaScript, targeting both the [browser](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/)browser and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). 

- Testing: [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/), [Rewire](https://github.com/jhnns/rewire)
- Type checker: [Flow](https://flow.org/)
- Build tools: [flow-remove-types](https://github.com/flowtype/flow-remove-types), [Browserify](http://browserify.org/), [unflowify](https://github.com/leebyron/unflowify)

To setup the environment:

```bash
make setup-environment
```
