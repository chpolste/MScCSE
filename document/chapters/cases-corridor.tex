2-dim control space.
Compare game complexity to double integrator with 1D control space.
Show how layered refinement adapts to corridor due to removal of known no-states.

Problematic performance of round-robin controller.
Show off layered-round robin reachability controller that does better job of guiding the trace through the corridor.
