Discrete-time continuous space system with continuous control and probabilistic linear dynamics.
LTL/GR(1) objective defined over linear predicates.
Almost-sure analysis and controller synthesis.

Procedure introduced by \cite[Svorenova2017] for computation of initial states of a discrete-time linear stochastic system such that a control strategy exists that almost-surely satisfies a specification in linear temporal logic.
The approach uses a 2Â½-player game abstraction build on iteratively refined partitions of the state space.
Demonstration of basic refinement for reachability problem.
Focus on reachability in general, no application to more complex specifications.
Computationally demanding procedure.
Performance of procedure linked to refinement performance.

Using their work as starting point, evolve the refinement framework and develop procedures that produce small state space partitions that are applicable to any GR(1)/LTL objective.
This addresses the issue of computational complexity by combatting the state space explostion problem.

Motivated by little experience with computational geometry, LSS abstraction, model checking of the author.
Build an educational tool, useful for interactive exploration.
Helps to build intuition for the problem and can be used for the testing of refinement heuristics with immediate feedback.

Focus on analysis and refinement, not controller synthesis which is a secondary, though related, problem.

Structure:
Introduce basic concepts, review the problem setup and solution procedure of \cite[Svorenova2017], then present refinement methods and the visualization tool and demonstrate capabilities and performance of refinement in two case studies.
