Shown here again, to demonstrate improvements in the refinement.
Challenge: limit-behaviour at edge.
TODO: proof that at boundary of Outer Attr, only a single control input point is usable, therefore procedure can never terminate.
Motivate shrinking of PreR again, which avoids this issue.
Explain why boundary behaviour inside the polytope is not as problematic and how random sampling is used to solve this.

Performance comparison: single-step Attr-/AttrR+ vs multi-step Attr- and layered refinement (vs multi-step static control?).
Layer-by-layer analysis with game simplification faster than one analysis for everything?

Also demonstrate with recurrence objective and how layered refinement overcomes the yes-states issues of AttrR+ refinement.
