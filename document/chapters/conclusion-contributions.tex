List of innovative things introduced in the thesis.

% TODO not given in any specific order
\startitemize[packed]
    \item{Evolution of positive robust refinement methods of \cite[Svorenova2017] (layer decomposition, multi-step robust refinement)}
    \item{Refinement framework, bigger picture approach, how to combine orthogonal ideas into new procedures (positive, negative, neutral. holisitic, subset. robust, probabilistic.)}
    \item{Neutral refinement with two concrete procedures (safety, self-loop removal)}
    \item{Application of the \cite[Svorenova2017] procedure to problems other than reachability}
    \item{Descriptions of how to handle cases such as co-safe interpretation and analysis result reuse in the game construction}
    \item{Interactive visualization with full implementation, useful as both an accessible research and educational tool}
    \item{A controller synthesis procedure based on a robust distance measure has been outlined and successfully demonstrated.
          The controller only guarantees satisfaction for robust dynamics but is memoryless.}
