Deterministic vs probabilistic refinement, missed potential but cost of deeper analysis required in probabilistic approaches.
Single-step vs. multi-step refinement and hybrid approaches.
Static control reduces system by removing player 1 and therefore enabling more efficient analysis of system at the cost of introduction of a piecewise dynamics.
Removing bad is more important than ensuring good.
As long as bad is avoided and no loops, good will happen eventually.
Problem that must be avoided: loops.
Removal of self-loops with PreR possible.
Discuss theoretical successes and practical problems of static control.

Discuss purely deterministic refinement and refinement that takes probabilistic aspect into account.
"Jagged" progress due to piecewise dynamics lead no much non-convexness which is computationally demanding.
More sophisticated action selection could resolve this, but fixed dynamics without recomputation after some steps will always have its limits.
