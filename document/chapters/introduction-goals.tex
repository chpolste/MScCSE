What did I set out to achive?
Formulate concrete goals:
\cite[Svorenova2017] foundation of thesis.
Application of the procedure to problems other than reachability, which was the focus of \cite[Svorenova2017].
Construct refinement procedures for general GR(1) objectives and investigate refinement techniques in general.
Personal perspective: little experience with computational geometry, LSS abstraction, model checking.

Built an educational tool, useful for interactive exploration.
Helps to build intuition for the problem which can be used for the design of refinement heuristics.

Focus on analysis and refinement, not controller synthesis which is a secondary, though related, problem.
